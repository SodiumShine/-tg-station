	Despite their name and appearance, Rockmen are not actually composed entirely of minerals, and are not at all abiogenic. They are living creatures, requiring
	air, food and water like many other organisms. It is merely their outer layers that resemble rock, in their composition as well as appearance and hardness.
	Their tough rock-like exterior is useful not only as a natural defence against physical attacks but renders them immune to fire and heat. Likely this is
	the result of evolution ensuring Rockmen will survive on their home planet, which is mostly volcanic. Rockmen are not capable of weilding firearms made for humans,
	or wearing most Nanotrasen made clothing and equipment, as their large bulky builds make such small items difficult to use. Additionally, they tend to move slowly.<BR>

	While seeming to lack intellect by comparison to other species, Rockmen are not actually any less intelligent than Humans,
	simply slower in the most physical sense. Unlike humans and many other races, they don't find themselves requiring many forms of comfort or leisure,
	making their culture seem less civilized at a glance.
